  Python compiler for the Neo Virtual Machine (Fork intended to provide standalone javascript)
</p>


The `neo-boa` compiler is a tool for compiling Python files to the `.avm` format for usage in the [Neo Virtual Machine](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm/) which is used to execute contracts on the [Neo Blockchain](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/).

The compiler supports a subset of the Python language ( in the same way that a _boa constrictor_ is a subset of the Python snake species)


#### What I was trying to do (in this fork)

My idea was to port neo-boa as a standalone javascript application, in order to provide an online compiler for Neo (with all computations made in client side).
During the last two weeks I fought three different battles and lost all three... So I didn't manage to port it, but I'll tell you what I tried, if you wanna try something else :)
